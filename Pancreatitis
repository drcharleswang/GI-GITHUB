If Pancreatitis
look for etoh, smoking, TG, Calcium
if normal and has two events
consider EUS to r/o obstruting issues, or stones


autoimmune
Serology includes an IgG4 greater than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of normal. 
Only 70-75% of patients will have an abnormal IgG4 level so a normal level does not rule out the condition. 
Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis is the pancreatic manifestation of IgG4-related disease and can impact 
over 11 organs including the bile duct, which is impacted here. Lastly, the first line of treatment is 
prednisone 40 mg for 4 weeks followed by a 5 mg per week taper for a total of 12 weeks. 
This patient should be considered for B-cell depletion therapy following initial treatment as he has a high 
risk for relapse given the biliary involvement, but steroids are still considered the first-line treatment 
at this time.

Type 2 AIP or IDCP is a rare, steroid-responsive form of pancreatitis which is typically diagnosed 
in younger patients (mean age 40 years). There is no gender bias (55% male) and serum IgG4 levels are 
less common than in type 1 AIP. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of infiltration of the pancreatic 
duct epithelial lining on core biopsy and these patients are highly steroid-responsive with a low relapse rate. 
While there is no associated extra-pancreatic organ involvement, approximately 15% of patients have concurrent 
inflammatory bowel disease, most notably ulcerative colitis.
