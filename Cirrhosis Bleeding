Because of the correlation between moderate to severe PHG and CSPH, patients with greater than mild PHG should be presumed to have 
CSPH and should be considered for prophylactic non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) to prevent decompensation. NSBBs are also recommended to 
prevent rebleeding from PHG. Endoscopic therapy, including argon plasma coagulation and hemospray, have been suggested in recent nonrandomized data 
to attenuate chronic blood loss with chronic PHG bleeding, however, is not considered the first line of therapy. Similarly, TIPS can be used in patients 
with transfusion-dependent 
PHG-related bleeding who do not respond to NSBB therapy but is not considered the first line of therapy.
