Polyp size is an independent risk factor for malignancy. Therefore, even in asymptomatic individuals, 
cholecystectomy is recommended for polyps ≥10 mm in size or polyps 6-9 mm in size with other risk factors. 
Polyp size of ≤5 mm is not an indication for cholecystectomy. 
Primary sclerosing cholangitis, not UC, is a risk factor for gallbladder neoplasia. 
Symptomatic patients with gallbladder polyps of any size should be referred for cholecystectomy. 
One of the risk factors for biliary neoplasia is age ≥60 years.
