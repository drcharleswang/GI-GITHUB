Globus

(rule out GERD, eoe, mano)

1. Presence of intermittent, non-painful sensation of a lump or foreign body in the throat with no structural lesion identified on physical examination, laryngoscopy, or endoscopy
a. Occurrence of the sensation between meals
b. Absence of dysphagia or odynophagia
c. Absence of gastric inlet patch in proximal esophagus
RFA/APC inlet patches (>2 cm) = improve globus symptoms for up to 2 years after ablation. (case study small 10-11 people)
-consider r/o thyroid issues with US/OSA

2. Absence of evidence of GERD or eosinophilic esophagitis
3. Absence of esophageal motor disorders

An ENT examination, if needed associated with laryngoscopy and thyroid ultrasonography (when thyroid abnormalities are suspected),
should be the first step to rule out any structural lesion of the oropharynx and larynx

WU:
If no alarm sxs: An empiric PPI trial 4-8 weeks.
EGD if non responsive or alarm sxs, 
EGD bx, tx inlet patch, Mano, consider pH monitoring

TX:
1) Half of globus patients have reported symptomatic benefit from mere reassurance - many resolve sxs and improve.
2) In a single RCT, 25 mg of daily amitriptyline was found to have a response rate of nearly 75% of enrolled globus patients.
3) Consider Speech Language Pathology Guided Behavioral therapy such as laryngeal recalibration therapy. PMCID: PMC11534515
There is a strong overlap between idiopathic globus and affective disorders, as many as 35% had anxiety disorder, and 13% had depression;
18% had borderline anxiety, while 28% had borderline depression.
