if IEL and VB and + CD serologies = Celiac Disease

Common Differentials:
  
NSAID use
SIBO IEL and VB
H Pylori VB only

VB + Travel to Tropical Country
Tropical Sprue = B12 def and weight loss = tx with DOXY

VB + Old White Male + Joint Pain
Whipples
PAS + Macrophages (AFB neg)
Tx = CTX + Bactrim long term


HIV < CD4
PAS + Macrophages AFB +
MAÇ infection, treat wtih Azithromycin

CVID
always sick
NEG PAS (no bacteria) + Macrophages
check Ig Levels

Uncontrolle CD can lead to NRCD - esp if you see severe weight loss
can lead to
Type I, Polypclonal IEL on bx
Type II (much worse), monoclonal -> EATL (lymphoma) 44% survival rate

Autoimmune enteropathy is suggested by the longstanding history of villous blunting despite a GFD and 
the concurrent history of an immune-mediated disorder, rheumatoid arthritis. While typically more common 
in males, several genetic conditions have been associated with the diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy to 
include IPEX (Immunodysregulation Polyendocrinopathy Enteropathy X-linked Syndrome) and APECED 
(Autoimmune Phenomena, Polyendocrinopathy, Candidiasis, and Ectodermal Dystrophy). In this case, 
subsequent genetic testing revealed a pathogenic sequence change in the CTLA4 gene consistent with a 
diagnosis of CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency
