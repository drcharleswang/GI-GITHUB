FH of colon cancer screening

FDR => 60 Advance Adenoma/CRC = SCREEN 40 (FIT OK), nl intervals ie 10 years if nothing
FDR < 60 Advance Adenoma/CRC = SCREEN 40 (COLON ONLY) or < 10 years Q5Y - needs COLON

If you have advance adenoma and NEG COLO x 2, then normal interval
If EMR then Q1Y, Q3Y, Q5Y

After piecemeal resection of non-pedunculated lesions ≥20 mm in size, a repeat colonoscopy is recommended in 6 months to assess for local recurrence 
and to clear the colon of synchronous lesions.
after piecemeal EMR (non-pedunculated lesions ≥20 mm) with the first surveillance colonoscopy at 6 months, and the intervals to the next colonoscopy 
at 1 year and then 3 years.

With only 2 non-advanced adenomas on her second colonoscopy, the recommended interval based on that procedure alone would be 7-10 years. However, 
for patients with an advanced adenoma removed on baseline colonoscopy, even if the 3-year follow-up colonoscopy has low-risk findings, as in this case, 
the recommended interval for the next surveillance is 5 years. Importantly, the shorter interval does not continue beyond the next procedure – if she again 
has low-risk findings on her third colonoscopy, the surveillance interval could stretch as long as 10 years.

If UC with LGD, then repeat colo in 3-6 months.

CPUE (colonic polyposis of unknown etiology). Guidelines suggest individuals with more than 20 cumulative lifetime adenomas and negative multigene cancer 
panel testing should have a colonoscopy every 1-2 years, colectomy if the colorectal polyposis burden is not endoscopically manageable, and baseline upper 
endoscopy at the time of the next colonoscopy surveillance or by age 20–25 years and repeat following the Spigelman stage of duodenal polyposis.

Consider ASCVD Calculator (esp if black, and smoker) - if > 10% should be ASA for CRC prevention. (40-59)
If BBPS section < 2 then 1 year repeat, if advance adenoma then < 1 year.
