Proctalgia Fugax - treatment is reassurance

Abdominophrenic dyssynergia (APD) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by an abnormal brain-gut reflex where the respiratory diaphragm contracts and the abdominal wall muscles relax during digestion, contrary to the normal response of diaphragm relaxation and abdominal muscle contraction.
 This paradoxical movement leads to abdominal distention, bloating, and discomfort, often described as feeling like one is constantly pregnant, and is a key contributor to symptoms in disorders of gut-brain interaction such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia.
 The condition is not due to increased intra-abdominal gas or contents but results from a disrupted viscerosomatic reflex, with studies showing diaphragmatic descent and anterior abdominal wall protrusion during distension episodes.
 While the exact cause remains unclear, it is thought to involve dysregulation of the gut-brain axis, and treatment options include diaphragmatic breathing exercises, cognitive behavioral therapy, gut-directed hypnotherapy, and biofeedback, though standardized protocols are still lacking
