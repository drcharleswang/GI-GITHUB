For colonic pseudo-obstruction/Ogilvie's cecum and proximal colon segments distension greater >12 cm is a known 
  risk factor for perforation. The next appropriate therapy is IV neostigmine when there are no known cardiac or 
pulmonary comorbidities which would be contraindications such as recent myocardial infarction, bradycardia, 
  significant asthma, etc. If there is no response to neostigmine or if there was a medical contraindication 
to neostigmine, colonoscopic decompression could be considered. Methylnaltrexone is an option in the setting of 
recent opioid use. Surgical ostomy, such as ileostomy or colostomy, is considered when medical and endoscopic 
treatments fail or if there is evidence of peritonitis, perforation and/or colon ischemia.

cecal volvulus in which the cecum twists around its mesentery. Emergent right hemicolectomy is the correct 
answer because cecal volvulus represents a true mechanical obstruction with a high risk of bowel ischemia, 
  necrosis, and perforation, necessitating definitive surgical treatment. Right hemicolectomy with ileocolonic 
anastomosis is preferred over detorsion alone due to the high recurrence rate of volvulus if the underlying 
anatomical abnormality is not corrected. The other options are incorrect because endoscopic decompression is 
ineffective for cecal volvulus, unlike sigmoid volvulus, and does not prevent recurrence.
