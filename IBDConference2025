TNF

once you have Ab - then likely to fail other mono tx TNFs (switch, unless do dual therapy) ?? - is this with max dose Q20/26 IBD 2023

patient's on 10mg/kg do not do as well on SQ

Vedo - less effective in TNF failure, longer response
inductin with IV then SQ
(can use 1st line for CD, but if TNF naive)

S1P - Ozanimod / Oral therapyt
concerns about CV, herpes
worse if prior biologic exposure
not good for pregnancy, h of macular edema/uveitis

IL23 p 19 --consider 2nd line after TNF fail (but IL23 over USTA)
mirikizumab (Omvoh) - 
guselkumab (Tremfya)
risankizumab (Skyrizi) - SQ -- good for psoriasis (especially after TNF psoariasis)
-good 2nd line agents for CD
(not goood for HepB)

Ustekinumab p40 subunit (Stelara)- very low immunogencity (IV induction) - consider safer than TNF

Jack2
Tofa (only UC approved)
Upadacitnib JAK1
(only if you wouldn't start TNF)
CV and smoking, shingles risk
had MACE effects - thereofre right now 1st line agents (but really < 65 and no ho of smoking)

UC
Pegnancy - anti TNF
Failed TNF - JAK, CD consider IL23
new - VDEO?

Crohn's Complications

Abscess with Fistula - ALMOST always will require SURG after primary drainage 

Peri anal Fistula - 1) IFX 2) if fails UPA
Intraabd abscess will likely needs surgery for drainage
DO NOT USE Vedo - it is weak for Crohns, especially after TNF failure (note not true for UC)
For women with ho of perianal Crohn’s disease, a cesarean section is recommended.

Stricture with CD
1st surgery, not penetrating, islated ileal resection
if calpro normal, colo normal can wait
High Risk = 2nd surgery < 10 years
needs MEDS, IFX and VEDO best data (OK even if exposed to TNF)

Crohn's Treatment:
A) < 20% low risk
older than > 30 yrs, small ileum disease, colon just apthomous ulcers - minimal sxs 
-don't need much tx, 9 mg - NO ASA/consider Sulfsalazine - Consider DIET even as tx
Consider RIS (Skyrizi) if fails
B) > 80% high risk
< 30 yrs, extensive involvement, perianal, DEEP ULCERS, stricture/penetrating/ho of surgery
START EARLY IFX, then UPA (Rinvoq)

4 drug island
IFX, RIZ IL23, VEDO, UPA

VEDO has RCT

Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC)
ASUC = 6 BM + , HR > 100, FEVER, 10.5 hb, ESR > 30 should be admitted for intravenous steroids, intravenous methylprednisolone 60 mg/d
to induce remission. Patients should have stool testing to rule out C. difficile infection. flexible sigmoidoscopy within 72 hours, and preferably within 24 hours of admission
to assess the endoscopic severity of inflammation and obtain biopsies to evaluate for cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis. 
If Albumin is < 2.5, consider IFX 10 mg/kg for salvage therapy.

ADA for CD, not in UC (better on VEDO) - esp for SB disease (UPA ? eff in SB dz)
non severe SB disease CD, IL23
