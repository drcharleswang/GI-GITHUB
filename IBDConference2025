ALGO for 2025: 4 drug island IFX, RIZ IL23, VEDO, UPA

UC Treatment:
A) low risk, Mayo 1, Left Sided, < 150 Fecal Calpro, Older
can consider VEDO/IFX if ASA fails
B) high risk, Mayo 3, DEEP ULCERS
IFX, and if fails UPA

Crohn's Treatment:
A) < 20% low risk
older than > 30 yrs, small ileum disease, colon just apthomous ulcers - minimal sxs 
-don't need much tx, 9 mg - NO ASA/consider Sulfsalazine - Consider DIET even as tx
Consider RIS (Skyrizi) if fails
Sulfasalzine rather than ASA for mild Crohns Colitis
B) > 80% high risk
< 30 yrs, extensive involvement, perianal, DEEP ULCERS, stricture/penetrating/ho of surgery
START EARLY IFX, then UPA (Rinvoq)
ADA is OK for small bowel CD (not UC)

MEDS:
ANTI TNF (great for UC and CD)
however risk of melanoma skin cancer, infection, myocarditis
track trough and Ab levels (IFX < 10), however note Ab levels can vary, if no sxs and trough is low just check again, do not just increase
once you have Ab - then likely to fail other mono tx TNFs (switch, unless do dual therapy) ?? - is this with max dose Q20/26 IBD 2023
note that ADA is great for CD, but VEDO is better than ADA for UC (Varisty Trail)
patient who need high levels of IFX 10mg/kg do not do as well on SQ
OK pregnancy

INTEGRIN
Vedo (great for UC, less CD)
once there is TNF failure, less effective
Great side effect profile very safe
OK pregnancy

IL23
RIS/USTA -| p19 IL23 subunit
RIS (risankizumab) Skyrizi - IV then SQ
IL23 p 19 --consider 2nd line after TNF fail esp in CD
good for TNF psoarisis (scalp hands)
LOW immunogencity despite large molecule in trail < 4%
also mirikizumab (Omvoh) / guselkumab (Tremfya) - no IV just SQ

USTA -| p40 IL23 subunit (Stelara)
pro very low immunogencity (IV induction) 
- consider safer than TNF

IL23 avoid in Hep B patient due to LFT issues
?? pregnancy (not a small MAB molecule)

JAK2
UPA (Upadacitnib) Rinvoq JAK -| for both UC and CD
Tofa Xeljanz (only UC approved) -- had black box DVT risk
most after failed TNF - esp in UC
had MACE effects - THEREFOR right now not a 1st line agents (but really < 65 and no ho of smoking)
containdications: CV and CAN NOT BE smoking, SHINGLES risk
check LIPID levels 12 weeks after starting
NOT pregnancy small molecule

S1P - Ozanimod - for UC
advantage it is ORAL med
NEEDS EKG concerns about CV conduction, herpes NEEDS ZOSTERS, Lipids
Eye Issue: macular edema/uveitis
NOT pregnancy small molecule

AZA - ok in pregnancy
increase in non melenoma skin cancer

MTX - NOT pregnancy
weekly dosing mainly for Ab formation

ASA - OK UC (Cr check yearly, colitis)
Sulfasalzine - cheap ASA - much more monitoring Q3M

PREGNANCY and IBD
NOT - JAK/S1P/MTX Cipro/Flagyl
? IL23
OK - IFX, VEDO, AZA
For women with ho of perianal Crohn’s disease, a cesarean section is recommended.

UC Complications

Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC)
ASUC = 6 BM + , HR > 100, FEVER, 10.5 hb, ESR > 30 should be admitted for intravenous steroids, intravenous methylprednisolone 60 mg/d
to induce remission. Patients should have stool testing to rule out C. difficile infection. flexible sigmoidoscopy within 72 hours, and preferably within 24 hours of admission
to assess the endoscopic severity of inflammation and obtain biopsies to evaluate for cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis. 
If Albumin is < 2.5, consider IFX 10 mg/kg for salvage therapy.
If CRP > 45 at Day 3 of inpt Travis, then surgery consult as HIGH colectomy rate
Most cases UC flares with C Diff, that do not respond to VANC are not C Diff, but FLARE - should trail steroids

Crohn's Complications

Abscess with Fistula - ALMOST always will require SURG after primary drainage 

Peri anal Fistula - 1) IFX 2) if fails UPA
Intraabd abscess will likely needs surgery for drainage
DO NOT USE Vedo - it is weak for Crohns, especially after TNF failure (note not true for UC)
For women with ho of perianal Crohn’s disease, a cesarean section is recommended.

Stricture with CD - 
if low risk 1st surgery, not penetrating, isolated ileal resection
if repeat calpro normal, colo normal can wait to start meds
if High Risk = 2nd surgery esp in < 10 years
needs MEDS, IFX and ??? VEDO best data (OK even if exposed to TNF)
Dilate with ballon to ? 20 mm

After surgery for stricture use scope in 6M (POCER STUDY)
use Rugereets Score, if > i2b (6 or more aphtomous ulcers before anastamosis of ileum) then increase or start MEDS
if i2a on the anastamosis or 5 or less aphtomous ulcers, then keep course and rescoep in 1-3 years
