patient's on 10mg/kg do not do as well on SQ

Vedo - less effective in TNF failure, longer response
inductin with IV then SQ
(can use 1st line for CD, but if TNF naive)

S1P - Ozanimod / Oral therapyt
concerns about CV, herpes
worse if prior biologic exposure
not good for pregnancy, h of macular edema/uveitis

IL23 p 19 --consider 2nd line after TNF fail (but IL23 over USTA)
mirikizumab (Omvoh) - 
guselkumab (Tremfya)
-good 2nd line agents for CD
(not goood for HepB)

risankizumab (Skyrizi) - SQ -- good for psoriasis (especially after TNF psoariasis)
Ustekinumab p40 subunit (Stelara)- very low immunogencity (IV induction)

Jack2
Upadacitnib JAK1
(only if you wouldn't start TNF)
CV and smoking, shingles risk
had MACE effects - thereofre right now 1st line agents (but really < 65 and no ho of smoking)

UC
Pegnancy - anti TNF
Failed TNF - JAK, CD consider IL23
new - VDEO?

Stricture with CD
1st surgery, not penetrating, islated ileal resection
if calpro normal, colo normal can wait
High Risk = 2nd surgery < 10 years
needs MEDS, IFX and VEDO best data (OK even if exposed to TNF)

CD 
< 20% low risk
> 30 yrs, small ileum, colon apthomous ulcers - minimal sxs 
-don't need much tx, 9 mg - NO ASA/consider Sulfsalazine - Consider DIET TX?

> 80% high risk
< 30 yrs, extensive involvement, perianal, DEEP ULCERS, stricture/penetrating/ho of surgery
START EARLY
