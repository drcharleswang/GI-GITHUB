If ascities albumin is 0.4 g/dL

The low protein in the ascitic fluid predisposes to the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP),
presumably from reduced opsonic capacity due to reduced complement levels and with additional risk factors such 
as advanced liver failure (Child-Turcotte-Pugh score >9 with bilirubin >3 mg/dL) or impaired renal function 
(creatinine >1.2 mg/dL, BUN >25 mg/dL, or sodium <130 mEg/L); therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis is 
recommended per current guidelines.
