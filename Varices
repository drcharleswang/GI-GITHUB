When to do Fibroscan:
if 1) FIB4 > 1.3, MALSD Fibrosis > -1.3 (1.455), APRI > 0.,5 (all if lower has no fibrosis)
consider VTCE AKA Fibroscan
usually if < 8 kPa no fibrosis, and no cirrhosis if < 15 kPa

Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by TE <10 kPa in the absence of other known clinical/imaging signs rule out cACLD, values between 10-15 kPa are suggestive of cACLD,
and values >15 kPa are highly suggestive of cACLD. 
 
  CSPH can be presumed in the presence of TE (1) LSM ≥25 kPa, (2) LSM between 20-25kPa and platelets <150 x109/L, or (3) LSM between 15-20 kPa and platelets <110 x109/L. 
CSPH should also be assumed in patients with cACLD and clinical signs of portal hypertension, including gastroesophageal varices, ascites, and portosystemic 
collateral vessels. Any patient meeting criteria for cACLD and CSPH should be treated with non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs), 
with carvedilol the preferred NSBB, and if tolerated, screening EGD is not required. Carvedilol therapy is recommended to start at a dose of 6.25 mg per day and, 
if tolerated, increase to 12.5 mg per day in a single dose or divided dose. When empiric NSBB are contraindicated or not considered due to prior intolerance, 
endoscopic surveillance of all patients with cirrhosis is recommended.

Esophageal Varices Screening:
use VTCE/Fibroscan and Plts to determine screening in NON DECOMP
If > 25kPa can just start NSBB (risk high)*
If > 20 but < 25 kPa look at Plt, if < 150 can just start NSBB (risk high), if > 150 then EGD
If > 15 but < 20 look at Plt, if < 110 can just start NSBB (risk high), if < 150 but > 110 then EGD, if > 150 then repeat in 1 year
SIMPLE rule is if < 20 kPa and Plt > 150 no EGD*
If < 15 kPa and Plt > 110 the repeat in 1 year as risk assessment in one year as risk is low*
DECOMP = HFE/Ascites/Bleeding
EGD screening Q1-2Y

Algo is: > 25kPa = NSBB (portal HTN)
> 20kPa if Plt < 150 = NSBB, if Plt > 150 = EGD
> 15kPa if Plt < 110 NSBB, if Plt > 110 and < 150 EGD?, if Plt > 150 screen in 1 year
< 15kPa and Plt > 150, rescreen in 1 year (no portal HTN)
< 8kPa no fibrosis
Bottom Line:
(> 25kPa and any Plt (even normal) = portal HTH, < 15 kPa and Plt > 150K = NO portal HTN, > 20kPa and Plt < 150K = portal HTN)

DURING SCREEN:
Esophageal Varices

If small - good evd for Childs B/C can start NSBB Coreg 3.125 Qd x 3, then BID (if HR < 55, then no need for repeat EGD) - 
even without Childs B, just cirrhosis can consider NSBB
If small and early stage, then repeat EGD in Q1 year (if ongoing liver dz) or Q2 year (if dz stopped ie etoh, treated HCV)
If no varices, then EGD repeat in Q2 year (if ongoing liver dz, can be earlier with decompensation) or Q3 year (if dz stopped ie etoh, treated HCV)

If medium-large - can EVL/until eradication, then Q1Y-2Y or NSBB (no more screening)

Bleeding
If EV with bleed and Childs C/Child B 7+ can consider TIPS even with EVL to improve survival.

Gastric Varcies
If IGV1 eradicate. If IGV2 or GOV2 NSBB. If GOV1 CT to r/o pancreatic issues if nothing then NSBB

NSBB - should not be started in cardiac arrhythmias, asthma, COPD, psoriasis, or peripheral vascular diseases [not appropriate for acute bleeding, just PPX]
Coreg 3.125 Qd x 3, then BID - aim for HR < 55 and watch for Na < 130/SBP < 90


FIB4 Scores:

Liver Stiffness (LSM) > 20kPa or Plt < 150 - can start Coreg
or EGD
NO EGD, if both LSM < 20 and Plt > 150
