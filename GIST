Lipoma bright (white) on 2nd layer


Hyperplastic polyps larger than 10 mm may harbor underlying dysplasia or carcinoma, so it would be prudent to resect them for more accurate histological diagnosis. 
This polyp does not display typical characteristics of a fundic gland polyp, which are small, sessile, often multiple, and occur in the corpus/fundus region.
As non-fundic gland polyps often arise in the setting
of mucosal pathology (such as gastric intestinal metaplasia), current guidance recommends systematic mucosal sampling as well.
