Indications to begin antiviral therapy in patients with chronic HBV without concern for significant hepatic fibrosis 
are: 1) ALT >2 times the upper limit of normal and HBV DNA >2,000 IU/mL for HBeAg negative patients, 
or 2) ALT >2 times the upper limit of normal and HBV DNA >20,000 IU/mL for HBeAg positive patients. 

UCSF Liver Conference
(liver dz outcomes at 40 --but between 30/40 ok) - will transition from immune tolerant to immune active

(all eAg +)
immune tolerant
normal ALT x 2, and HBV DNA > 10,000,000 in HBeAg +
> 40 yo with sig inflammation => grade 2 or fibrosis => f2 canc sondier life long tx
< 40 yo old no tx, unless desired

immune active
eAg neg, low VL, high ALT

alt 1-2 x ULN
DNA > 10,000,000
if => 40 and => f2 disease

else > 20,000 - ? immune active

< 2000 IU - 1000
if DNA is very low, and ALT is high - don't consider tx if no cirrhosis - as he likely is not having Hep B causing inflammation
ALT can by high in MASLD

if < 1000 IU - very unlikely contributing to risk so do not treat, if ALT is elevated

(African's HCCa risk is higher) but in therpauetics they are HBeAg neg and thus not immune active
