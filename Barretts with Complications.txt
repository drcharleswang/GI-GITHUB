Active surveillance of BE with low-grade dysplasia (LGD) on chronic acid suppression is reasonable but not for patients with HGD. 

HGD = RFA (if nodule resection)
LGD (confirmed) = RFA (preferred) vs

NO TREATMENT SURVEILLANCE:
Monitoring LGD - Q6M EGD x 2, with 1 cm bx (optimize PPI tx) - 6M, 12M, then Q1Y
Monitoring InDeF = Q6M EGD with 1 cm bx (optimize PPI tx), 1) if repeat shows INDEF then Q1Y until NL x 2, then resume normal NDBE 2) if NL then normal NDBE 

POST RFA TX SURVEILLANCE:
Post RFA of BE with high-grade dysplasia or T1a,
= EGD at 3M, +3M at 6M, + 6M at 12M, then Q12M forever (4 EGD in 2Y)
Post RFA of BE with LGD
= EGD in 1Y, +2Y at Y3, the Q2Y forever
(take bx at GEJ, and then 1 CM for 2-5 cm past in distal esophagus)

Esophageal Adenoca Nodule:
If < 2 cm no high-risk features (bulky lesion, suspected deep invasion), both EMR and ESD are OK.

Screen 
if 2 RF out of 6:
5 Yrs Gerd, Fat, White, Smoking, Male, 1FDR BE/EsoCa
OR ASGE recommends EGD after sleeve gastrectomy, 3yrs, then Q5Ys for BE due to possible 11.4% development

No repeat EGD:
1) After Neg Screening:
Pts without esophagitis or BE on index EGD, the incidence of BE on subsequent endoscopy is low (lifetime) 2.3-4.2%.
2) Stop for <5-year life expectancy (70 in worse health), ? over age 75 years of age.
