(NDBE) NonDysplastic Barrett's = C1M2 (M is always larger)
take 2 cm biopsies, unless first diagnosis then at least 8
if pathology is normal:
if < 3 cm, then repeat in 5 years (risk = 1/1000)
if > 3 cm, then repeat in 3 years (risk 1/100)

If INDEF (check with pathology x 2), optimizie PPI and EGD Q6M with 1cm bx until negative x 2, then normal NDBE
surveillance of 3-5 years
IF dysplasia = RFA unless pt refuses
IF pt refuses and LGD then optimize PPI EGD Q6M with 1 cm bx, negative x 2, then Q1Y x 2?, then normal NDBE
HGD = RFA!
T1a Cancer = EMR (not ESD due to stricture)
If < 2 cm no high-risk features (bulky lesion, suspected deep invasion), both EMR and ESD are OK.
T1b = SURG (unless low risk, ie < 500 um, no LVI, well diff EAC)

POST RFA Ablation SURVEILLANCE:
(take bx at GEJ, and then 1 CM for 2-5 cm past in distal esophagus)
Post RFA of BE with LGD
= EGD in 1Y, +2Y at Y3, the Q2Y forever
Post RFA of BE with high-grade dysplasia or T1a,
= EGD at 3M, +3M at 6M, + 6M at 12M, then Q12M forever (4 EGD in 2Y)



When to Screen for BE 
if 2 RF out of 6:
5 Yrs Gerd, Fat, White, Smoking, Male, 1FDR BE/EsoCa
OR ASGE recommends EGD after sleeve gastrectomy, 3yrs, then Q5Ys for BE due to possible 11.4% development

No repeat EGD:
1) After Neg Screening:
Pts without esophagitis or BE on index EGD, the incidence of BE on subsequent endoscopy is low (lifetime) 2.3-4.2%.
2) Stop for <5-year life expectancy (70 in worse health), ? over age 75 years of age.
