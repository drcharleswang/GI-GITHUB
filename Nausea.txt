Nausea

Although many patients and physicians are greatly concerned about the risks of metoclopramide, these risks have likely been overstated. 
An analysis of data from the UK found only 4 documented cases of TD with 16 million doses. 
A population study in Scandinavia estimated the risk of developing TD with metoclopramide use at 1 in every 2,000-2,800 treatment years. 
In many cases, TD appears to be an idiosyncratic reaction and patients should be cautioned appropriately. 
Although data is limited, the most common risk factor identified include age > 70, female gender, > 20 months of use, and higher doses (32 mg/day).
