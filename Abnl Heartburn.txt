Heartburn Sx:


Functional Disease:
Functional heartburn = refractory heartburn sx with a negative pH study = tx with neuromodulator. Buspar potential too.
< 4% Acid Time, neg SAP



Abnormal Manos:

EGJOO elevated median IRP > 15 (basically achalasia with swallows)
+ ≥20% swallows with elevated intrabolus pressure in the supine position, with evidence of peristalsis
If sxs of dysphagia confirm with TBD with a 13-mm barium tablet and/or functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP)
Tx: botox injection, pneumatic dilation, (POEM), Heller all possible

NL DCI is 450 and 8,000 
< 450 = weak peristalsis and < 100 mmHg = failed swallow


DCI > 8,000 = hypercontractile
CCv4C for hypercontractile esophagus (>20% swallows have DCI >8000 + sx DYSPHAGIA +/- NCCP).
R/O 2ndary causes: GERD (40% have it as cause), opiate use, EoE, and EJOO
