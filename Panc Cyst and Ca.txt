Pancreatic Cyst:

PANC CYST:
Follow if < 3 cm, for 5 years:
< 1 cm, Q2Y MRI - after 4Y can lengthen
1-2cm, Q1Y MRI - after 3 years, Q2Y MRI - after 4Y lengthen
2-3M, EUS/FNA or MRI Q1Y x 4 years
Consider EUS if growth > 2.5 mm/year

EUS/FNA [3/5/a criteria] if > 3 cm or dilated PD > 5 mm (2-4 mm nl), atrophy, LAD, CA19-9

							Main Duct* = Surg
							Side Branch, if Sx, PD > 10 mm*, > 5 mm nodule*
							< 20 mm, then repeat 6M, Q18M, then stop if stable 5Y
							> 20 mm < 30 mm, Q6M x 2, then Q12M - stop based on comorbid

Pancreatic Cancer:
Lift ime risk is 1.7%, 5Y survival is 13%
Consider Screening with Yearly MRCP if:
1) PRSS1 - screen 40 y/o or 20 years after 1st AP episode
2) PJ (STK11) Hamartomas, screen age 40
3) FAMMM, screen 50 or -10 years relative dx
4) => 2 FDR, screen age 50
5) Lynch/BRCA, 50yo  if 1FDR or -10 yrs

WU:
MRCP
Courvoisier, palpable GB / Trousseau: superficial vein clot
CA 19-9 > 37 IU/mL Sn 81%, Sp 89%

Mass in head of Pancreas:
Panc Ca - < 180 wrap of with veins, no artery contact - or surg futile
T bili 2.3-14.6, if Surgery within 1 week, ERCP should not be done due to complications
vs Meta Analysis showed no morality/morbidity differences
